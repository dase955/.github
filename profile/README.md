# Lab Overview

Welcome to the **Candy Lab** of the [School of Data Science and Engineering (DaSE)](https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn) at [East China Normal University (ECNU)](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/). As a prominent research group, we thrive on exploring and pushing the boundaries of how machine learning can redefine and revolutionize the world of database management.

### Our Vision
Our main vision is to create an intelligent and self-adaptive data management system that seamlessly integrates cutting-edge machine learning techniques. By doing so, we aim to unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, reliability, and scalability in data management tasks.

### Core Research Areas
We are deeply passionate about a multitude of research topics within the broad spectrum of database management. Currently, our primary research interests encompass:

- **AI4Storage**: Here, we delve into the integration of AI with storage technologies. Key areas of focus include:
  - Non-volatile memory: Exploring how machine learning can optimize and enhance the functionalities of persistent memory structures.
  - LSM-tree (Log-Structured Merge-tree): Investigating the fusion of AI techniques to improve the performance and efficiency of LSM-tree operations.

- **AI4Optimizer**: Optimization lies at the heart of efficient data management. Our interests in this domain include:
  - Cardinality estimation: Employing AI to refine the predictability of the number of rows returned by a query, which is essential for optimizing query performance.

- **AI4Operations**: Elevating database operations through AI-driven strategies is one of our core pursuits. Key topics under this umbrella are:
  - Index recommendation: Harnessing machine learning algorithms to suggest optimal indexing strategies for databases, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.

- **Vector DB**: In the realm of databases, vector databases are becoming increasingly crucial for tasks such as similarity search. Our focus areas include:
  - ANNS (Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search): Leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance the speed and accuracy of searches within large-scale datasets.

Join us in our journey as we blend traditional database management principles with state-of-the-art machine learning advancements to shape the future of data science and engineering.
